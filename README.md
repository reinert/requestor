With the componentization movement, much attention has been given to the UI structure of a frontend application.
We have developed many mechanisms to build UIs prepared to scale. Unfortunately, communication - the underlying
process that feeds the UI - has not evolved accordingly. Although we have seen ideas like promises and observables
being adopted to handle asynchronous calls, orchestrating the communication layer with the UI
components is still left aside. It's not so hard to see well UI structured apps with a messy
communication (or service/api) layer. Apart from that, there are some patterns and strategies that we can apply in the
communication process to make it smoother and coordinated among the different UI components. In fact, ruling
the communication process is the foundation for building sustainable and scalable frontend applications.

Requestor is an event-driven HTTP Client API for cutting-edge frontend applications. It offers plenty of
carefully designed features to empower the development of **communication-centric apps**. By focusing on the
communication process as the core of frontend development, Requestor allows developers to combine requesting
configuration with state management in several scope levels so that each UI component is exempted from the
communication complexity and can interact with other components in a decoupled way.

Feature highlights:
* [**Requesting Fluent API**](#requesting-fluent-api-briefing) - code as you think, read as you code.
* [**Event-Driven Callbacks**](#event-driven-callbacks) - set callbacks for different results in a precise event system.
* [**Serialization**](#serialization) - serialize and deserialize payloads integrating any library.
* [**Authentication**](#authentication) - make complex async authentication procedures in a breeze.
* [**Middlewares**](#processors-middlewares) - asynchronously filter and intercept requests and responses.
* [**HTTP Polling**](#poll) - make long or short polling with a single command.
* [**Retry**](#retry) - define a retry policy with a single command.
* [**Session**](#session) - manage all requesting configurations in one place.
* [**Service**](#services) - break down the API consumption into smaller independent contexts.
* [**Store**](#store) - save and retrieve data in different scope levels (session, service and request).
* [**Links**](#links-hateoas) - navigate through an API interacting with its links (HATEOAS for real).
* [**Headers**](#headers-api) - directly create and parse complex headers.
* [**URIs**](#uri) - build and parse complicated URIs easily.
* [**Binary Data**](#binary-data) - upload and download files tracking the progress.

Requestor is developed on top of three main pillars: (1) **Interoperability**, (2) **Simplicity**, and (3)
**Extensibility**. In that fashion, **requestor-core** is developed in vanilla Java 5 syntax what makes it compatible
with any Java based platform. To provide a fully working implementation, Requestor impls are required to implement only
the dispatching mechanism through the wire (two functions basically). Currently, there is one requestor impl available
for **GWT2**: **requestor-gwt**. For Requestor v2, there are two implementations under development: one for JVM/Android
and another for J2CL.


## Preview

Make a GET request and deserialize the response body as String:

```java
Session session = new GwtSession();
session.get("https://httpbin.org/ip", String.class).onSuccess( ip -> Window.alert(ip) ); // or Window::alert
```

Make a POST request sending a serialized object in the payload:

```java
Book book = new Book("Clean Code", "Robert C. Martin", new Date(1217552400000L));
session.post("/api/books", book).onSuccess( view::showSuccessMsg ).onFail( view::showErrorMsg );
```

GET a collection of objects:

```java
session.get("/api/books", List.class, Book.class).onSuccess( books -> renderTable(books) );
```

**Note**: Check the [Serialization](#serialization) section to enable ***auto-serialization***.

The above examples are shortcuts in Session class to make quick requests.
Additionally, you can access the fluent API to build and send more complex requests.

### Requesting Fluent API *(briefing)*

Requesting involves three steps:
1) Access the request builder by calling `requestor.req( <uri> )`, and **set the request options** 
   through the chaining interface.
2) Following, we must **call one of the invoke methods**, represented by the corresponding HTTP 
   methods (*get*, *post*, *put*, and so on). In this action, we specify the type we expect to 
   receive in the response payload.
3) Finally, we receive a Request instance, which allows us to **chain callbacks** according to 
   different outcomes.


```java
session.req("/api/books/1")              // 0. Start building the request
       .timeout(10_000)                  // 1. Set the request options
       .header("ETag", "33a64df5") 
       .get(Book.class)                  // 2. Invoke an HTTP method with the expected type
       .onSuccess(book -> render(book))  // 3. Add callbacks to the request
       .onFail(response -> log(response));
```

See the [Requesting Fluent API](#requesting-fluent-api) section to know more details of how it 
works.

Meet all the request options available in the [Request Options](#request-options) section.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Set up your Session

Requestor features a configurable client [Session](#session). There we *set default request options* 
that apply to all requests. Additionally, since the `Session` is also a [Store](#store), we can use it to *save and
retrieve data*, sharing state among components that rely on that session if necessary. 
Eventually, we can *reset the session state* at any time.

```java
Session session = new GwtSession();

// Set all requests to have 10s timeout and 'application/json' Content-Type
session.setTimeout(10_000);
session.setContentType("application/json");

// Perform login, save user info, and authenticate all subsequent requests
session.post("/login", credentials, UserInfo.class)
        .onSuccess(userInfo -> {
            // Save the user info in the session store
            session.save("userInfo", userInfo);
            // Set the default auth for every session request
            session.setAuth(new BearerAuth(userInfo.getToken()));
        });

// Make authenticated requests
session.post("/api/books", book);

// Retrieve data from the session store
UserInfo userInfo = session.retrieve("userInfo");

// Clear the session state
session.reset();

// Clear all data from the store
session.clear();

// Now all requests will have the default parameters
session.post("/api/books", book);
```


### Looking for some REST? üò™

Requestor offers a pre-defined REST client so that we can perform basic CRUD operations against 
a resource. See the example below on how to create a new `RestService`.

```java
bookService = RestService
        .of(Book.class, Integer.class) // <entityClass>, <idClass>
        .at("/api/books")              // <rootPath>
        .on(session);                  // <session>

// Configure your service to always set Content-Type and Accept headers as 'application/json'
bookService.setMediaType("application/json");

// POST a book to '/api/books' and receive the created book from server
Book book = new Book("RESTful Web Services", "Leonard Richardson", new Date(1179795600000L));
bookService.post(book).onSuccess(createdBook -> render(createdBook));

// GET all books from '/api/books'
bookService.get().onSuccess(books -> render(books));

// GET books from '/api/books?author=Richardson&year=2006'
bookService.get("author", "Richardson", "year", 2006).onSuccess(books -> render(books));

// GET the book of ID 123 from '/api/books/123'
bookService.get(123).onSuccess(books -> render(books));

// PUT a book in the resource with ID 123 from '/api/books/123' and receive the updated book
bookService.put(123, book).onSuccess(updatedBook -> render(updatedBook));

// PATCH book's title and year in '/api/books/123' and receive the updated book
bookService.patch(123, book, "title", "year").onSuccess(updatedBook -> render(updatedBook));

// DELETE the book of ID 123 from '/api/books/123' (returns void)
bookService.delete(123).onSuccess(() -> showSuccess("Book was deleted."));
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è Although Requestor provides this generic REST client, extending the `AbstractService` class and 
implementing our service clients is more beneficial. `AbstractService` affords the advantage of
little coding while empowering complete control of the requesting logic. Consequently, it 
improves the testing capabilities and bug tracking. See more details in the [Service](#services) 
section.


## Installation

Add the following requestor impl dependency to your POM.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.reinert.requestor.impl</groupId>
    <artifactId>requestor-gwt</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Then, make requestor available to your GWT project by importing the implementation's module.

```xml
<inherits name="io.reinert.requestor.gwt.RequestorGwt"/>
```

Requestor primarily focuses on the HTTP Client API. Hence, **requestor-core** provides most of the
features but delegates some internals, like the network operation, to the implementations.

Currently, there is one impl available: **requestor-gwt**. It implements requestor for the 
GWT environment. The **requestor-gwt** impl is compatible with any GWT2 version and Java 5+ API.

### Latest Release

1.0.0 (14 Mar 2022)


## Yet another REST Client library?

*No. Not at all*. Requestor is an **HTTP Client API** intended to provide several features related to network communication.
Its scope is broader than popular (and often misunderstood) REST patterns. Requestor precisely models each entity in the
HTTP client-side context to enable its users to handle any requirement in this boundary. It values good **code readability
and maintainability** for the user by providing carefully designed interfaces and abstractions that others can extend and
add their logic with **low or zero integration effort**. Workarounds and hacks are not welcome here. Developers should be able
to implement their requirements keeping **high cohesion** through all their codebase.

Additionally, Requestor was crafted from the Client perspective instead of the Server's (like other rest libraries were thought).
In that fashion, developers have a more **consistent and intuitive experience** consuming HTTP services while coding. We do not
need to pre-declare Server API's fa√ßades. We can just consume them on demand. This approach empower us to build *micro clients*
that interact with many different *micro services*.

Besides, we value **code traceability**. So code generation is the last option in design decisions. Whenever a new requirement appears,
we strive to develop a good design solution that allows the user to write less code and achieve the desired results. If something proves
to be inevitably repetitive on the user side, after reaching the best possible design, then code generation is used to save the user
from repetitive work. Still, leveraging Requestor's components, people will probably automate most of their work using fundamental
object-oriented techniques like inheritance and composition. This way, they will better comprehend what is going on and have complete
control of the coding flow.

With Requestor, we can:
* Quickly make offhand requests writing as little code as possible.
* Communicate with different HTTP APIs keeping the same client communication pattern, thus improving the codebase maintainability.
* Handle multiple media types (JSON and XML, for instance) for the same java type without hacks.
* Deserialize different types according to the response status, properly modeling error messages in our app.
* Navigate through discoverable REST API links, fully leveraging HATEOAS.
* Build different and complex queries on demand, not having to map each possible iteration with Server APIs previously.
* Add new logic requirements not needing to change existing classes, instead of creating new small units, avoiding code conflict between co-workers.


## Request Options

Requestor's Fluent API exposes many chaining methods to properly configure your request.

Suppose you start building the request below:

```java
RequestInvoker req = session.req("/api/books/");
```

### *payload*

Set an object as the request payload. This object is then serialized into the HTTP message's body
as part of the [request processing](#processors-middlewares) after its invocation.

```java
req.payload( "a simple string" );
req.payload( new Book("RESTful Web Services", "Leonard Richardson", new Date(1179795600000L) );
req.payload( Arrays.asList(book1, book2, book3) );
```

Optionally, we can specify the fields we want to be serialized. In this case, the Serializer
must implement the required logic to filter the informed fields during serialization.

```java
Book book = new Book("RESTful Web Services", "Leonard Richardson", new Date(1179795600000L);
req.payload( book, "title", "author" ); // Inform the serializer to filter title and author only
```

### *auth*

Set an `Auth` implementation to properly authenticate your request. This async functional interface
is capable of supplying the request with the required credentials and later sending it.

```java
req.auth( new BasicAuth("username", "password") );
req.auth( new BearerAuth("a-secret-token") );
req.auth( new MyOwnAuth("whatever") );
```

### *accept*

A shortcut to set the Accept header.

```java
req.accept( "application/json" );
```

### *contentType*

A shortcut to set the Content-Type header.

```java
req.contentType( "application/json" );
```

### *header*

Set an HTTP header informing a key-value pair or a [Header](#headers-api) type.

```java
req.header( "Accept-Language", "da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7" );
req.header( new QualityFactorHeader("Accept-Language", "da", 1.0, "en-gb", 0.8, "en", 0.7) );
```

### *timeout*

Set a period in milliseconds in which the request should be timeout.

```java
req.timeout( 10_000 ); // Timeout after 10s
```

### *delay*

Set a time in milliseconds to postpone the request sending.
The [request processing](#processors-middlewares) will happen only after the delay period. 

```java
req.delay( 5_000 ); // Delay the request for 5s
```

### *retry*

Set a retry policy for the request with two arguments: (1) an array of `delays` in milliseconds and (2) an array of `events`.
The **delays** array is a sequence of times that Requestor will wait before retrying the request respectively.
It also indicates the number of retries that will be performed at most. Furthermore, the **events** array is
a set of events that will trigger a retry. Occurring a request event that is defined in the retry police,
the [callbacks](#event-driven-callbacks) bound to those events are not executed and a retry is triggered. These callbacks will be executed only
after all retries defined in the retry police were made and the retry event persisted to occur.

Regarding the `delays` argument, although we can provide an int array manually, we will often resort to the `DelaySequence`.
It is a factory that provides helpful methods to create sequences of delays according to different criteria.
* **DelaySequence.arithmetic**( *\<initialSeconds\>, \<commonDiff\>, \<limit\>* ) - creates a millis int array with an arithmetic sequence.
  * Ex: `DelaySequence.arithmetic(5, 20, 3)` generates `int[]{5000, 25000, 45000}` 
* **DelaySequence.geometric**( *\<initialSeconds\>, \<ratio\>, \<limit\>* ) - creates a millis int array with a geometric sequence.
    * Ex: `DelaySequence.geometric(3, 2, 4)` generates `int[]{3000, 6000, 12000, 36000}`
 * **DelaySequence.fixed**( *\<seconds\>...* ) - creates a sequence with the given seconds array multiplied by 1000.
    * Ex: `DelaySequence.fixed(5, 15, 45)` generates `int[]{5000, 15000, 45000}`

As for the `events` argument, Requestor has a set of pre-defined events in the `RequestEvent` enum, matching the events
that we can bind [callbacks](#event-driven-callbacks) to. Additionally, any `StatusFamily` or `Status` is also an event.
Check some examples of events:
* `RequestEvent.FAIL` - request receives a response with status ‚â† 2xx
* `RequestEvent.TIMEOUT` - request has timed out with no response
* `RequestEvent.CANCEL` - request has been cancelled before receiving a response
* `RequestEvent.ABORT` - request has been aborted before sending either manually or due to a runtime exception in the processing cycle
* `StatusFamily.CLIENT_ERROR` - request receives a response with status = 4xx
* `StatusFamily.SERVER_ERROR` - request receives a response with status = 5xx
* `Status.TOO_MANY_REQUESTS` - request receives a response with status = 429
* `Status.of(429)` - request receives a response with status = 429

```java
// Set the request to retry on 'timeout' or '429' responses
req.retry( DelaySequence.geometric(3, 2, 4), RequestEvent.TIMEOUT, Status.TOO_MANY_REQUESTS )

// Set the request to retry on 'cancel' or '429' and '503' responses
req.retry( DelaySequence.arithmetic(5, 20, 3), RequestEvent.CANCEL, Status.of(429), Status.of(503) )

// Set the request to retry on 'timeout', '4xx' and '529'
req.retry( DelaySequence.fixed(5, 15, 45), RequestEvent.TIMEOUT, StatusFamily.CLIENT_ERROR, Status.SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE )
```

### *poll*

Needing to ping an endpoint in a specific interval, we can set the poll option with the 
`PollingStrategy` and the `interval` in milliseconds. Additionally, we can set the maximum 
number of requests to stop the polling by informing the `limit` argument.

```java
// Send the request each 3s
req.poll( PollingStrategy.SHORT, 3_000 );

// Send the request each 3s up to the limit of 10 requests
req.poll( PollingStrategy.SHORT, 3_000, 10 );
```

There are two PollingStrategy choices: **LONG** or **SHORT**.
* `PollingStrategy.LONG` - Long polling means the subsequent request will be dispatched only 
  **after receiving the previous response**.
  * If we set an interval, the following request will only be delayed after the previous 
    response has come.
* `PollingStrategy.SHORT` - On the other hand, with Short polling, the subsequent request will 
  be dispatched right **after the previous request has been sent**.
    * If we set an interval, then the following request will be delayed by this interval as 
      soon the previous request is dispatched.

```java
// The next requests are dispatched 3s after the previous ones
req.poll( PollingStrategy.SHORT, 3_000 );

// The next requests are dispatched as soon the responses are received
req.poll( PollingStrategy.LONG ); // Same as `req.poll( PollingStrategy.LONG, 0 )`

// The next requests are dispatched 10s after previous responses up to the limit of 5 requests
req.poll( PollingStrategy.LONG, 10_000, 5 );
```

In both cases, if we also set the request's delay option, then the subsequent dispatches' 
*total delay* = *request delay* + *polling interval*.

```java
// The first request is delayed by 2s and the next ones are delayed by 5s (2 + 3)
req.delay(2_000).poll( PollingStrategy.SHORT, 3_000 );
```

Furthermore, not setting a *polling limit*, we can manually ***stop*** the polling by calling 
`request.stopPolling()`.

```java
session.req("/api/books/")
       .poll(PollingStrategy.LONG)
       .get()
       .onLoad(new ResponseRequestCallback() {
           @Override
           public void execute(Response response, PollingRequest<Void> request) {
               if (request.getPollingCounter() == 3) {
                   request.stopPolling(); // Stop polling after receving the third response
               }
           }
       });
```

It is worth noting that each new dispatched request will pass through all the [request/response 
processing cycle](#processors-middlewares). Thereby, we will have every polling request always up 
to date with our filters, serializers, and interceptors.

Finally, if we set a retry police, each dispatched request will execute the retries individually as well,
before triggering the retry events.

## Event-Driven Callbacks

Requestor defines an event system according to the [Request Lifecycle](#processors-middlewares).
We can add as many callbacks as we need for each event that may occur.
The events are divided into two main categories: **Error** events and **Load** events.
The `error` event is triggered whenever the request is interrupted before receiving a response.
It is subdivided into three events: `abort` (request interrupted before being sent), `cancel` (request interrupted after being sent), and `timeout` (request expired before receiving a response).
The `load` event is triggered whenever a request receives a response. It is subdivided into two events: `success` (2xx response received), `fail` (~2xx response received).
Additionally, any Status Code is also an event. So, if a 201 response is received, the `201` event is triggered.
Finally, the Status Families are also events. Thus, a 201 response triggers the `2` event as well.

Besides those events, Requestor also fires the `progress` and `upProgress` events to enable us tracking download and upload progress respectively.
While the `error` or `load` events are triggered once per request call, the `progress` and `upProgress` events are triggered many times per call. 

![request-events](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1285494/146399333-8294288f-b5b8-4cf6-bcee-e8e2fe939695.png)

After invoking a request, we receive a `Request<T>` instance. It is a deferred object that 
allows us to chain callbacks to handle any event that the request may produce. Besides that, 
we can also access all request options that formed this request.

One `Request<T>` will fire either a `load` event or a `error` event only once.
But when setting the [poll](#poll) option while building a request, we receive a `PollingRequest<T>`.
It may trigger `error` or `load` events many times, once per each call that is made.
Additionally, the `PollingRequest<T>` interface extends from `Request<T>` and allows us to access the polling options that formed it as also manually stop the poll.
Notice, nevertheless, that Requestor treats every request as a polling request under the hood.
So even a simple request is a polling request of one call only.
That is the reason why every request needs a [Deferred Pool Factory](#deferredpool-factory). 

A `Request<T>` gives access to the response body as `T` if it resolves successfully (2xx).
The available events to add callbacks for are listed below. All arguments are optional.
  * **onSuccess**( [payload [, response [, request]]] -> {} )
    * executed when the response *is successful* (status = 2xx)
    * features the *deserialized payload* and the *response* (optional)
  * **onFail**( [response [, request]] -> {} )
    * executed if the response *is unsuccessful* (status ‚â† 2xx)
    * features the *response*
  * **onLoad**( [response [, request]] -> {} )
    * executed if the response *is completed*, regardless of *success or failure*
    * features the *response*
  * **onStatus**( statusCode|statusFamily, ( [response [, request]] ) -> {} )
    * executed when the response *returned the given status code/family*
    * features the *response*
  * **onProgress**( [progress [, request]] -> {} )
    * executed many times while the request is being sent
    * features the *progress* that enables tracking the download progress
  * **onUpProgress**( [progress [, request]] -> {} )
    * executed many times while the response is being received
    * features the *progress* that enables tracking the upload progress
  * **onTimeout**( [timeoutException [, request]] -> {} )
    * executed when a timeout occurs
    * features the *timeoutException*
  * **onCancel**( [requestException [, request]] -> {} )
    * executed if the request was *cancelled after being sent* (either manually by the user or due to network error)
    * features the *cancelException*
  * **onAbort**( [requestException [, request]] -> {} )
    * executed if the request was *aborted before being sent* (either manually by the user or due to any runtime error)
    * features the *abortException*
  * **onError**( [requestException [, request]] -> {} )
    * generic error callback that is executed if the request *could not get a response overall* due to any reason (aborted, cancelled or timed out)
    * features the original *exception*

See how you can use them below:

```java
session.get('/server/ip', String.class).onSuccess(new PayloadCallback<String>() {
    public void execute(String ip) {
        // This is executed if the response was successful (status = 2xx)
        view.showIp(ip);
    }
}).onSuccess(new PayloadResponseCallback<String>() {
    public void execute(String ip, Response r) {
        Window.alert("Response status was " + r.getStatus.toString());
    }
}).onFail(new ResponseCallback() {
    public void execute(Response r) {
        // This is executed if the response was unsuccessful (status ‚â† 2xx)
        view.showError("Request failed. Server message: " + r.getPayload().toString());
    }
}).onLoad(new ResponseCallback() {
    public void execute(Response r) {
        // This is executed if a response is received, regardless of the status
        Window.alert("Response status was " + r.getStatus.toString());
    }
}).onStatus(429, new ResponseCallback() {
    public void execute(Response r) {
        // This is executed if the response status code 429
        view.showError("Too many requests. Please try again in a few seconds.");
    }
}).onStatus(StatusFamily.SERVER_ERROR, new ResponseCallback() {
    public void execute(Response r) {
        // This is executed if the response status code was 5xx (server error)
        view.showError("Request failed. Server message: " + r.getPayload().toString());
    }
}).onProgress(new ProgressCallback() {
    public void execute(RequestProgress progress) {
        // This is executed many times while the response is being received
        if (progress.isLengthComputable())
            view.setDownloadProgress( (progress.getLoaded() / progress.getTotal()) * 100 );
    }
}).onUpProgress(new ProgressCallback() {
    public void execute(RequestProgress progress) {
        // This is executed many times while the request is being sent
        if (progress.isLengthComputable())
          // getCompletedFraction(int factor) calculates (loaded/total)*factor
          view.setUploadProgress(progress.getCompletedFraction(100));
    }
}).onTimeout(new TimeoutCallback() {
    public void execute(RequestTimeoutException e) {
        // This is executed if the request timed out before receiving a response
        view.showError("Request timed out: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}).onCancel(new ExceptionCallback() {
    public void execute(RequestException e) {
        // This is executed if the request was cancelled after being sent
        view.showError("Request cancelled: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}).onAbort(new ExceptionCallback() {
    public void execute(RequestException e) {
        // This is executed if the request was aborted before being sent
        view.showError("Request aborted: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}).onError(new ExceptionCallback() {
    public void execute(RequestException e) {
        // This is executed if the request could not receive a response overall
        
        if (e instanceof RequestTimeoutException) // Check if it's a timeout error
            view.showError("Request timed out: " + e.getMessage());
        
        if (e instanceof RequestCancelException) // Check if it's a cancel error
            view.showError("Request cancelled: " + e.getMessage());
        
        if (e instanceof RequestAbortException) // Check if it's an abort error
            view.showError("Request aborted: " + e.getMessage());
    }
});
```

**NOTE:** If an error occurs, and we did not set a callback for that error kind, than the exception is thrown.
Thus, the errors are not hidden if we forgot to add handlers for them.

### Success callbacks and Collections

When requesting, we will always receive a `Request<Collection<T>>` despite the particular 
collection type (*List*, *Set*, and so on) we asked due to a design limitation of the Java 
language, which does not allow "generics of generics." Nevertheless, we can declare the 
collection we demanded in the callback to typecast the result automatically.
See the example:

```java
// An ArrayList was requested, but the get method returned a Request<Collection<Book>>
Request<Collection<Book>> request = session.req("/server/books").get(ArrayList.class, Book.class);

// Even though we can declare a List<Book> as the callback's parameterized type
request.onSuccess(new PayloadCallback<List<Book>>() {
    public void execute(List<Book> payload) {
        ...
    }
});
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è When using **lambda expressions**, we must explicitly declare the demanded collection type in 
the signature to access it. Check below:

```java
// An ArrayList was requested, but the get method returned a Request<Collection<Book>>
Request<Collection<Book>> request = session.req("/server/books").get(ArrayList.class, Book.class);

// The payload parameter in callback is a Collection<Book>
request.onSuccess( books -> books.get(0) ); // COMPILATION ERROR: books is Collection<Book> and .get belongs to List

// You can explicitly declare the type in lambda signature to typecast
request.onSuccess( (List<Book> books) -> books.get(0) ); // OK: Now it works
```

## Serialization

Serialization is part of the [Request Processing](#processors-middlewares), and deserialization is 
part of the [Response Processing](#processors-middlewares).

Requestor exposes the `Serializer` interface responsible for serializing and deserializing a 
specific type while holding the **Media Types** it handles. Therefore, it is possible 
to have multiple Serializers for the same Java Type handling different Media Types, e.g., JSON and 
XML. Requestor's serialization engine is smart enough to **match** the appropriate **Serializer** 
according to the asked class and the request/response's **Content-Type**.

To enable serialization and deserialization, we must register a `Serializer` instance in the
[session](#session). Necessitating only the deserialization part, we can register a 
`Deserializer` implementation.

```java
session.register(new MyTypeSerializer());
```

Additionally, we can register a `Provider` instead of an actual Serializer instance. It is a 
factory that will provide the Serializer instance on demand. When Requestor's serialization engine 
matches a serializer according to the class and media type, it asks the Provider for an 
instance. If this instance is disposable (i.e., it is not living in an outer context), the 
garbage collector will free up some memory after its usage. See how to register a Serializer 
Provider:

```java
register(new SerializerProvider() {
    @Override
    public Serializer<?> getInstance() {
        return new MyTypeSerializer(); // return a disposable instance instead of a reference
    }
});

// Lambda syntax
session.register(MyTypeSerializer::new); // Same as `session.register(() -> new MyTypeSerializer())`
```

**üí° PRO TIP**: If you start having too many serializers, consider registering them with `Providers` to save memory.

Although it is possible to implement our custom Serializers, we often resort to **AUTO-SERIALIZATION**
provided by requestor extensions. Currently, there are two available: `requestor-gwtjackson` and
`requestor-autobeans`.

### Gwt-Jackson auto-serialization

The `requestor-gwtjackson` extension integrates gwt-jackson into requestor to provide auto 
serialization. Intending to have the Serializers automatically generated, we just need to 
declare a `SerializationModule` annotating it with the required classes. Additionally, we can 
set the **Media Types** the serializers should handle. Since gwt-jackson serializes to JSON 
format, "application/json" is the default media type, but you can declare other media types, even 
wildcard types like "\*/json" or "\*/\*".

```java
@MediaType({"application/*json*", "*/javascript"})
@JsonSerializationModule({ Author.class, Book.class })
interface MySerializationModule extends SerializationModule {}
```

According to this example, when asking for `Author.class` or `Book.class`, all three scenarios 
below will match the auto-generated serializers:

```java
// Matches 'application/*json*' to serialize the payload
session.req("/books").contentType("application/json+gzip").payload(book).post();

// Matches 'application/*json*' to deserialize the response's payload
// assuming the response's content-type was really 'application/stream+json'
session.req("/books").accept("application/stream+json").get(List.class, Book.class);

// Matches '*/javascript' to deserialize the response's payload
// assuming the response's content-type was really 'text/javascript'
session.req("/authors/1").accept("text/javascript").get(Author.class);
```

We do not need to register the auto-generated serializers in our session instance. This 
is automatically done under the hood if we instantiate a `JsonSession`.

```java
// All generated serializers will be automatically registered in this session
Session session = new JsonSession();
```

In order to install requestor-gwtjackson extension, add the following dependency to your project:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.nmorel.gwtjackson</groupId>
    <artifactId>gwt-jackson</artifactId>
    <version>${gwtjackson.version}</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>io.reinert.requestor.ext</groupId>
    <artifactId>requestor-gwtjackson</artifactId>
    <version>${requestor.version}</version>
  <dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Then inherit the `RequestorGwtJackson` GWT module in your gwt.xml file:

```xml
<inherits name="io.reinert.requestor.gwtjackson.RequestorGwtJackson"/>
```

### AutoBean auto-serialization

Similarly to the previous extension, `requestor-autobean` provides auto serialization for 
AutoBean interfaces. Likewise, we declare a SerializationModule with the classes and media types 
to generate the serializers.

```java
@MediaType({"application/json", "*/*"})
@AutoBeanSerializationModule({ Author.class, Book.class })
interface MySerializationModule extends SerializationModule {}
```

We do not need to register the auto-generated serializers in our session instance. This
is automatically done under the hood if we instantiate an `AutoBeanSession`.

```java
// All generated serializers will be automatically registered in this session
Session session = new AutoBeanSession();
```

Further, Requestor graciously enables us to create new AutoBean instances directly from the 
Session by calling `session.getInstance(<Class>)`.

```java
Book book = session.getInstance(Book.class);
```

The installation procedure is conventional.

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>io.reinert.requestor.ext</groupId>
    <artifactId>requestor-autobean</artifactId>
    <version>${requestor.version}</version>
  <dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Then inherit the `RequestorAutoBean` GWT module in your gwt.xml file:

```xml
<inherits name="io.reinert.requestor.autobean.RequestorAutoBean"/>
```

### Implementing a Serializer

Besides auto-serialization, Requestor's users can also write their own custom serializers. Check 
the following sample of a raw handwritten `Serializer`.

```java
class BookXmlSerializer implements Serializer<Book> {

    @Override
    public Class<Book> handledType() {
        return Book.class;
    }

    @Override
    public String[] mediaType() {
        // Return an array of media-type patterns; wildcards are accepted
        return new String[]{ "*/xml*" };
    }

    @Override
    public SerializedPayload serialize(Book book, SerializationContext ctx) {
        return new TextSerializedPayload(
                "<book><title>" + book.getTitle() + "</title>"
                + "<author>" + book.getAuthor() + "</author>"
                + "<pubDate>" + book.getPubDate().getTime() + "</pubDate></book>");
    }

    @Override
    public SerializedPayload serialize(Collection<Book> books, SerializationContext ctx) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("<array>");
        for (Book b : books) sb.append(serialize(b, ctx).asString());
        sb.append("</array>");
        return new TextSerializedPayload(sb.toString());
    }

    @Override
    public Book deserialize(SerializedPayload payload, DeserializationContext ctx) {
        String response = payload.asString();
        int titleStart = response.indexOf("<title>") + 7;
        int titleEnd = response.indexOf("</title>", titleStart);
        String title = response.substring(titleStart, titleEnd);

        int authorStart = response.indexOf("<author>", titleEnd) + 8;
        int authorEnd = response.indexOf("</author>", authorStart);
        int author = Integer.parseInt(response.substring(authorStart, authorEnd));

        int pubDateStart = response.indexOf("<pubDate>", authorEnd) + 9;
        int pubDateEnd = response.indexOf("</pubDate>", pubDateStart);
        Date pubDate = new Date(Long.parseLong(response.substring(pubDateStart, pubDateEnd)));

        return new Book(title, author, pubDate);
    }

    @Override
    public <C extends Collection<Book>> C deserialize(Class<C> collectionType, SerializedPayload payload, DeserializationContext ctx) {
        String response = payload.asString();
        C collection = ctx.getInstance(collectionType);

        int cursor = response.indexOf("<book>");
        while (cursor != -1) {
            int cursorEnd = response.indexOf("</book>", cursor);
            collection.add(deserialize(new TextSerializedPayload(response.substring(cursor + 6, cursorEnd)), ctx));
            cursor = response.indexOf("<book>", cursorEnd);
        }

        return collection;
    }
}
```

#### Inheritance

Additionally, when the `Serializer` should handle sub-types of the target type, we can extend 
the `HandlesSubTypes<T>` interface and implement the `handledSubTypes` method, like below: 


```java
// Implement the HandlesSubTypes interface
class BookXmlSerializer implements Serializer<Book>, HandlesSubTypes<Book> {

    @Override
    public Class<Book> handledType() {
        return Book.class;
    }

    @Override
    public List<Class<? extends Book>> handledSubTypes() {
        // Return other types that this serializer handles
        return Arrays.asList( AudioBook.class, PaperBook.class );
    }
    
    // rest of the serializer ...
}
```


## Authentication

Requestor features the `Auth` functional interface responsible for authenticating the requests as the last step in the [Request Processing](#request-processing). It delivers the credentials to the request and ultimately sends it. Like any other processor, the Auth interface is an **async callback**. Therefore, after performing the necessary changes in the request, it must call `request.send()` to really send it. Moreover, we may find it advantageous to use the Session's Store to retrieve credential info. Check the following example:

```java
session.req("/api/authorized-only")
        .auth(new Auth() {
            @Override
            public void auth(PreparedRequest request) {
                // Retrieve the token from the store
                String userToken = request.retrieve("userToken");
                
                // Provide the credentials in the Authorization header
                request.setHeader("Authorization", "Bearer " + userToken);
                
                // Your request will be hanging forever if you do not call `send`
                request.send();
            }
        });
```

This is an example of how to perform a usual authentication. Indeed, this logic is already provided
by the [`BearerAuth`](#bearer-token) implementation.

Notice that Auth's async nature enables us to do complex stuff before actually providing the credential data
to the request. We can perform other asynchronous tasks before properly configuring the request. If, for instance,
we need to ping another endpoint to grab some token data, we can easily do it. Check the example below:

```java
session.req("/api/authorized-only")
        .auth(request -> {
            // We are reaching another endpoint sending a password to get an updated token
            session.post("/api/token", "my-password", String.class)
                    .onSuccess(token -> {
                        // After receiving the updated token, we set it into the request and send it
                        request.setHeader("Authorization", "Bearer " + token);
                        request.send();
                    });
        });
```

We may do any other useful async task, like performing heavy hash processes using *web workers*, before sending the request.

Additionally, Requestor allows us to register an Auth `Provider` instead of the `Auth` instance. The Provider is a **factory**
that returns an `Auth` instance for each request. It is really valuable when implementing authentication mechanisms
that require state management, like the `DigestAuth`. Check an example below of how to register an `Auth.Provider` in
the Session:

```java
session.setAuth(new Auth.Provider() {
    @Override
    public Auth getInstance() {
        // Supposing you implemented MyAuth elsewhere
        return new MyAuth( session.retrieve("userToken") );
    }
});
    
// Lambda syntax
session.setAuth( () -> new MyAuth(session.retrieve("userToken")) );
```


### Basic

In order to facilitate our development, Requestor provides standard Auth implementations. For instance, the `BasicAuth` performs the **basic access authentication** by putting a header field in the form of `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`, where credentials is the Base64 encoding of `username` and `password` joined by a single colon `:`. It might be helpful to retrieve credentials data from the Session Store, like in the following example:

```java
User user = session.retrieve("user");

session.req("/api/authorized-only")
        .auth(new BasicAuth( user.getUsername(), user.getPassword() ));
```

BasicAuth optionally accepts a third boolean param called `withCredentials`. It will instruct the 
browser to allow cross-site requests.

### Bearer Token

Correspondingly, the `BearerAuth` performs the **bearer token authentication** by adding a header to the request in the form of `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
See how you can enable this Auth in your Session to all requests using a `Provider`:

```java
session.setAuth(() -> {
    UserInfo userInfo = session.retrieve("userInfo");
    return new BearerAuth(user.getToken());
});
```

BearerAuth optionally accepts a second boolean param called `withCredentials`. It will instruct the
browser to allow cross-site requests.

### Digest
Requestor provides a ready-to-use `DigestAuth` supporting **qop** (*auth* or *auth-int*) and 
**md5** hash algorithm.

Instantiate `DigestAuth` in the requests, sessions or services passing the `username`, 
`password` and the `algorithm`. Optionally, there is a fourth boolean `withCredentials` param to make cross-site 
requests:

```java
String username = "username";
String password = "password";
String hashAlgo = "md5"
boolean withCredentials = true;

session.req("/api/protected") 
        .auth(new DigestAuth(user, password, hashAlgo, withCredentials))
        .get();
```

When registering `DigestAuth` in the [Session](#session) or [Service](#services), it is recommended 
to do it through a `Provider` to avoid sharing the internal Auth state between requests:

```java
// register a Provider of DigestAuth in the session
session.setAuth(() -> new DigestAuth(session.retrieve("username"), session.retrieve("password"), "md5"));
```

### CORS
When we need to hit external public endpoints, browsers requires us to set `withCredentials` 
request param to true. Requestor offers the `CorsAuth` authenticator that does it 
automatically to us.

```java
session.req("https://external-domain.com") 
        .auth(new CorsAuth()) 
        .get(); 
```


### OAuth2
Requestor provides client-side OAuth2 authenticators supporting both *header* and *url query param* 
strategies. It is made available by the `requestor-oauth2gwt` extension.

To enable OAuth2 authentication, set the callback url in your oauth provider as `mydomain.com/oauthWindow.html`.  


In order to use it in you app, first install the extension dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.reinert.requestor.ext</groupId>
  <artifactId>requestor-oauth2gwt</artifactId>
  <version>${requestor.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Next, inherit the `RequestorOAuth2` GWT module in your gwt.xml file:

```xml
<inherits name="io.reinert.requestor.gwt.oauth2.RequestorOAuth2"/>
```

Then, according to the required authorization strategy we can either instantiate 
`OAuth2ByHeader` or the `OAuth2ByQueryParam` passing the `authUrl` and the `appClientId`.
Optionally, we can also inform a sequence of `scopes`: 

```java
session.req("https://externaldomain.com/oauth2") 
        .auth(new OAuth2ByQueryParam(authUrl, appClientId, scope1, scope2, ...))
        .get(); 
```

When registering an OAuth2 Auth in a [Session](#session) or in a [Service](#services), it is 
recommended to do it through a `Provider` to avoid sharing the internal Auth state between requests:

```java
// register a Provider of OAuth2ByHeader in the session
session.setAuth(() -> new OAuth2ByHeader(session.retrieve("authUrl"), session.retrieve("appClientId")));
```

## Processors (middlewares)

One of the library's main features is the ability to introduce ***asynchronous hooks*** to 
process requests and responses. These middlewares are called **Processors**. Furthermore, it is 
essential to note that each processor kind has a specific capacity that differentiates it from 
others. Thus, it helps us to organize our application's communication processing stack better.

The request and response processing are include in the **REQUEST LIFECYCLE** as follows:
1. User builds and invokes a new **Request** through the **Session**
2. Request is processed by `RequestFilters`
3. Request is processed by `RequestSerializer` and serialized
4. Request is processed by `RequestInterceptors`
5. Request is processed by `Auth` and *sent* to network
6. **Response** is *received* from network
7. Response is processed by `ResponseInterceptors`
8. Response is processed by `ResponseDeserializer` and deserialized
9. Response is processed by `ResponseFilters`
10. User receives the processed Response

![request-lifecycle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1285494/146391548-e44c0c83-5488-4455-a88e-3f7cdf7ff8a4.png)

All processors are able to manipulate the request/response, but they have the following 
distinguishing characteristic according to its kind:
* **Filters** - they can modify the *deserialized* payload
* **Serializers / Deserializers** - they perform payload serialization and deserialization
* **Interceptors** - they can modify the *serialized* payload

We can register as many **Filters** and **Interceptors** as we want in a **Session**. They are 
executed in the same order they were registered.

Regarding the **Auth**, there is only one available *per* ***Request***. We can register a default 
Auth in the Session using `session.setAuth(<Auth>)`, but we can override it when building a request.
Refer to the [Auth](#auth) section for more details.

As for the **RequestSerializer** and **ResponseDeserializer**, there is only one available *per* 
***Session***. They resort to the **SerializationEngine** to perform serialization and 
deserialization. The engine holds the registered **Serializers** and is responsible for 
de/serializing objects according to the *class* and *media type*.

### Request Filter

A `RequestFilter` hooks an undergoing deserialized request (`RequestInProcess`) to modify it, even 
its payload, or perform any other action that fits the business requirements triggered by a new
request. As any other **Processor**, the **RequestFilter** is ***asynchronous***, so we must call
`request.proceed()` to move the request forward in the request processing.

We can add a `RequestFilter` to the **Session** by calling `session.register(<RequestFilter>)`. 

```java
session.register(new RequestFilter() {
    @Override
    public void filter(RequestInProcess request) {
        // Access the Store bounded to this request/response lifecycle
        String encoding = request.retrieve("encoding");

        // Modify the request headers
        request.setHeader("Accept-Encoding", encoding);

        // Modify any other request option, including the payload
        request.setPayload(null);

        // Call proceed otherwise the request hangs forever
        request.proceed();
    }
});
```

In addition to registering a **RequestFilter** instance, we can instead register a `Provider` to 
create new filter instances for each new request. This is useful if a filter relies on some 
internal state that should not be shared among other request lifecycles. See how to register it:

```java
session.register(new RequestFilter.Provider() {
    @Override
    public RequestFilter getInstance() {
        // Suposing you implemented MyRequestFilter elsewhere
        return new MyRequestFilter();
    }
});

// Lambda syntax
session.register(MyRequestFilter::new); // Same as `session.register(() -> new MyRequestFilter())`
```

Besides proceeding with the request, we can alternatively ***abort*** it by calling
`request.abort(<MockResponse>|<RequestAbortException>)`. Check below:

```java
session.register(new RequestFilter() {
    @Override
    public void filter(RequestInProcess request) {
        // Abort the request with a fake response
        request.abort(new MockResponse(Status.BAD_REQUEST));
    }
});
```

If we abort with `MockResponse` then **load** callbacks are triggered,
as well **success** and **status** depending on the response status code.
Otherwise, if the request is aborted with `RequestAbortException`, then **abort** 
callbacks are triggered.

### Request Serializer

A `RequestSerializer` receives a `SerializableRequestInProcess` along with the
`SerializationEngine`. It is supposed to serialize the request and proceed with
the request processing. The engine uses the registered **Serializers** to serialize 
the request matching the payload object *class* and the request's *content-type*.

There is only one `RequestSerializer` per Session, and it can be set with
`session.setRequestSerializer(<RequestSerializer>)`. Check the default implementation below:

```java
session.setRequestSerializer(new RequestSerializer() {
    @Override
    public void serialize(SerializableRequestInProcess request,
                          SerializationEngine engine) {
        // The engine is capable of serializing the request
        engine.serializeRequest(request);
        // It's possible to perform any async task during serialization
        request.proceed();
    }
});
```

### Request Interceptor

A `RequestInterceptor` hooks an undergoing serialized request (`SerializedRequestInProcess`) to 
modify it, even its payload, or perform any other action that fits the business requirements 
triggered by a new request. As any other **Processor**, the **RequestInterceptor** is 
***asynchronous***, so we must call `request.proceed()` to move the request forward in the 
request processing.

We can add a `RequestInterceptor` to the **Session** by calling `session.register(<RequestInterceptor>)`. 

```java
session.register(new RequestInterceptor() {
    @Override
    public void intercept(SerializedRequestInProcess request) {
        // Access the Store bounded to this request lifecycle
        String encoding = request.retrieve("encoding");

        // Modify the request headers
        request.setHeader("Accept-Encoding", encoding);

        // Modify any other request option, including the serialized payload
        String json = request.getSerializedPayload().asString();
        SerializedPayload jsonp = SerializedPayload.fromText(")]}',\\n" + json);
        request.setSerializedPayload(jsonp);

        // Call proceed otherwise the request hangs forever
        request.proceed();
    }
});
```

In addition to registering a **RequestInterceptor** instance, we can instead register a `Provider` to 
create new interceptor instances for each new request. This is useful if an interceptor relies 
on some internal state that should not be shared among other request lifecycles. See how to 
register it:

```java
session.register(new RequestInterceptor.Provider() {
    @Override
    public RequestInterceptor getInstance() {
        // Suposing you implemented MyRequestInterceptor elsewhere
        return new MyRequestInterceptor();
    }
});

// Lambda syntax
session.register(MyRequestInterceptor::new); // Same as `session.register(() -> new MyRequestInterceptor())`
```

Besides proceeding with the request, we can alternatively ***abort*** it by calling
`request.abort(<MockResponse>|<RequestAbortException>)`. Check below:

```java
session.register(new RequestInterceptor() {
    @Override
    public void interceptor(SerializedRequestInProcess request) {
        // Abort the request with an exception
        request.abort(new RequestException(request, "Manually aborted"));
    }
});
```

If we abort with `MockResponse` then **load** callbacks are triggered,
as well **success** and **status** depending on the response status code.
Otherwise, if the request is aborted with `RequestAbortException`, then **abort** 
callbacks are triggered.

### Response Interceptor

A `ResponseInterceptor` hooks an incoming serialized response (`SerializedResponseInProcess`) to
modify it, even its serialized payload, or perform any other action that fits the business 
requirements triggered by a new response. As any other **Processor**, the **ResponseInterceptor**
is ***asynchronous***, so we must call `response.proceed()` to move the response forward in the
response processing.

We can add a `ResponseInterceptor` to the **Session** by calling `session.register(<ResponseInterceptor>)`.

```java
session.register(new ResponseInterceptor() {
    @Override
    public void intercept(SerializedResponseInProcess response) {
        // Modify the response headers
        response.setHeader(new ContentTypeHeader("application/json"));

        // Modify any other response option, including the serialized payload
        String jsonp = response.getSerializedPayload().asString();
        SerializedPayload json = SerializedPayload.fromText(jsonp.substring(8));
        response.setSerializedPayload(json);

        // Call proceed otherwise the response hangs forever
        response.proceed();
    }
});
```

In addition to registering a **ResponseInterceptor** instance, we can instead register a `Provider` to
create new interceptor instances for each new response. This is useful if an interceptor relies 
on some internal state that should not be shared among other request lifecycles. See how to 
register it:

```java
session.register(new ResponseInterceptor.Provider() {
    @Override
    public ResponseInterceptor getInstance() {
        // Suposing you implemented MyResponseInterceptor elsewhere
        return new MyResponseInterceptor();
    }
});

// Lambda syntax
session.register(MyResponseInterceptor::new); // Same as `session.register(() -> new MyResponseInterceptor())`
```

### Response Deserializer

A `ResponseDeserializer` receives a `DeserializableResponseInProcess` along with the
`SerializationEngine`. It is supposed to deserialize the response and proceed with
the response processing. The engine uses the registered **Deserializers** to deserialize
the response matching the asked payload *class* and the response's *content-type*.

There is only one `ResponseDeserializer` per Session, and it can be set with
`session.setResponseDeserializer(<ResponseDeserializer>)`. Check the default implementation below:

```java
session.setResponseDeserializer(new ResponseDeserializer() {
    @Override
    public void deserialize(DeserializableResponseInProcess response,
                            SerializationEngine engine) {
        // The engine is capable of deserializing the response
        engine.deserializeResponse(response);
        
        // It's possible to perform any async task during deserialization before proceeding
        response.proceed();
    }
});
```

### Response Filter

A `ResponseFilter` hooks an incoming deserialized response (`ResponseInProcess`) to
modify it, even its serialized payload, or perform any other action that fits the business
requirements triggered by a new response. As any other **Processor**, the **ResponseFilter**
is ***asynchronous***, so we must call `response.proceed()` to move the response forward in the
response processing.

We can add a `ResponseFilter` to the **Session** by calling `session.register(<ResponseFilter>)`.

```java
session.register(new ResponseFilter() {
    @Override
    public void filter(ResponseInProcess response) {
        if (!response.hasHeader("Custom-Header"))
            response.setHeader("Custom-Header", "Added after response was received");

        // Check if the caller requested to deserialize the payload as String
        if (response.getPayloadType().getType() == String.class) {
            String payload = response.getPayload().asObject();
            response.setPayload(payload + "\nWE JUST MODIFIED THE PAYLOAD!");
        }

        // Call proceed otherwise the response hangs forever
        response.proceed();
    }
});
```

In addition to registering a **ResponseFilter** instance, we can instead register a `Provider` to
create new filter instances for each new response. This is useful if a filter relies
on some internal state that should not be shared among other request lifecycles. See how to
register it:

```java
session.register(new ResponseFilter.Provider() {
    @Override
    public ResponseFilter getInstance() {
        // Suposing you implemented MyResponseFilter elsewhere
        return new MyResponseFilter();
    }
});

// Lambda syntax
session.register(MyResponseFilter::new); // Same as `session.register(() -> new MyResponseFilter())`
```

## Session

Requestor is a session-based HTTP client. It means that a **Session** ties every configuration and action a user can take related to communication. Thus, the `Session` object is the baseline of every communication process in the application. What is better, Requestor does not restrict its users to having only one global Session. We can have ***as many sessions as it makes sense*** according to our business requirements. For example, if we are building a modern client app, we may communicate with different microservices. It may be reasonable to have one Session for each microservice with different configurations. This flexibility promotes a much more **reliable and maintainable code** since we can isolate different business logics in their own context, avoiding runtime conflicts and undesirable multi-path coding.

To instantiate a new `Session`, we can call `new Session()`, but Requestor implementations will often provide specific sessions. For instance, **requestor-gwt** has the `GwtSession` with a predefined configuration for JSON-based communication. Additionally, we can implement our Session subclass, including the configurations that fit our requirements.

```java
Session session = new Session();
```

Besides allowing registration of many [Processors](#processors-middlewares), the Session admits setting many default request options. Along with that, it is possible to reset the Session state.

```java
session.reset()
```

This method will reset all the Session's request options to their default values.

### Session's Request Options

The same request options made available by the `Session` are also provided by in any [`Service`](#services).

#### Media-Type

This session configuration will be applied to every request's Content-Type and Accept headers.

```java
session.setMediaType("application/json");
```

#### Headers

We can set any header to be shared among all session's requests.

```java
// Set a header into the session
session.setHeader("Accept-Encoding", "gzip");

// Get a header from the session
Header header = session.getHeader("Accept-Encoding");

// Remove a header from the session
boolean removed = session.delHeader("Accept-Encoding");
```

#### Auth

This session configuration will be applied to every request's [`auth`](#auth) option. We can 
either register an `Auth` instance or a `Provider`.

```java
// The same Auth instance will be used by all requests
session.setAuth( new BearerAuth(session.retrieve("token")) );

// By setting a Provider, each request will have a new Auth instance
// Helpful to restrict the Auth's internal state to the request lifecycle
session.setAuth( () -> new BearerAuth(session.retrieve("token")) );
```

#### Timeout

This session configuration will be applied to every request's [`timeout`](#timeout) option.

```java
// Every request will have a timeout of 20s
session.setTimeout(20_000);
```

#### Delay

This session configuration will be applied to every request's [`delay`](#delay) option.

```java
// Every request will have a delay of 3s
session.setDelay(3_000);
```

#### Retry

This session configuration will be applied to every request's [`retry`](#retry) option.

```java
// Every request will have a retry policy of 5s, 10s and 30s on 429 responses
session.setRetry(DelaySequence.fixed(5, 10, 30), Status.TOO_MANY_REQUESTS);
```

### Requesting

The Session is the starting point to build requests. We access the request builder by calling `session.req(<Uri>)`. Since the builder is also an invoker, we can call an invoke method any time to send the request. The invoke methods are named according to the respective HTTP methods they claim. All those methods are chainable, as demonstrated below:

```java
// Start requesting informing the URI
RequestInvoker req = session.req("/api/book/1")

// Set up the request
req = req.timeout(5_000)

// Invoke the request
Request<Book> request = req.get(Book.class);

// All together
Request<Book> request = session.req("/api/book/1")
        .timeout(5_000)
        .get(Book.class);
```

In order to better understand the requesting mechanics, refer to the [Requesting Fluent API](#requesting-fluent-api) section.

In addition to the fluent request builder and invoker exposed by the `req` method, the Session features **direct invoker methods** that quickly dispatch requests.

```java
Book book = new Book("Clean Code", "Robert C. Martin");

// Same as `session.req("/api/books").payload(book).post(Book.class)`
Request<Book> request = session.post("/api/books", book, Book.class);
```

### DeferredPool Factory

Another convenient feature is the possibility of instantiating a Session with a customized `DeferredPool.Factory`. This factory provides `Deferred` instances to the request dispatcher, returning a `Request` to the Session's user. Thus, we can immediately add some global callbacks to keep our code DRY when generating a Deferred instance.

The example below demonstrates a customized Deferred Factory that fires a `ShowLoadingEvent` right before the request is sent and fires a `HideLoadingEvent` once the request gets [loaded](#event-driven-callbacks) ('load' event) or [interrupted](#event-driven-callbacks) ('error' event).

```java
class AppDeferredPoolFactory implements DeferredPool.Factory {

    @Override
    public <T> DeferredPool<T> create(SerializedRequest request) {
        final DeferredPollingRequest<T> deferred = new DeferredPollingRequest<T>(request);

        // Show loading widget before sending the request
        APP_FACTORY.getEventBus().fireEvent(new ShowLoadingEvent());

        // Hide loading widget on load or abort
        deferred.onLoad(() -> APP_FACTORY.getEventBus().fireEvent(new HideLoadingEvent()))
                .onError(() -> APP_FACTORY.getEventBus().fireEvent(new HideLoadingEvent()));

        return deferred;
    }
}
```

Therefore, we can instantiate our Session with this customized Deferred Pool Factory, as demonstrated below:

```java
Session session = new Session(new AppDeferredPoolFactory());
```


## Store

Requestor features a component to save and retrieve objects by key: the `Store`. The `Session`, the `Service`, the `Request`, and the `Response` types extend the `Store` interface so that all of them provide such functionality.

When a Store is generated from another store, it is linked to the previous Store in a tree structure. This structure allows the Stores to maintain their own scope of saved data while delegating queries to the parents when they do not find an object.

For example, if we create a Request from a Session, the Request is a Store linked to the Session Store. Differently, if we create a Request from a Service, the Request Store is linked to the Service Store. In its turn, since a Service is created from a Session, the Service Store is linked to the Session Store.

Also, note that when a Request produces a Response, they share the same Store. So there is one Store only in a Request-Response lifecycle.

A Store provides the following operations:

```java
interface Store {

    // Queries an object associated with the given key.
    <T> T retrieve(String key);

    // Saves the value into the store associating with the key.
    // Returns the same store to enable save chaining.
    Store save(String key, Object value);

    // Saves the value associating with the key in a upstream store according to the specified level.
    // To persist in the immediate parent store, set the level param to Level.PARENT.
    // To persist in the root store, set the level param to Level.ROOT.
    // Returns the same store to enable save chaining.
    Store save(String key, Object value, Level level);

    // Checks if there's an object associated with the given key.
    boolean exists(String key);

    // Checks if there's an object associated with the given key and if it's equals to the given value.
    boolean isEquals(String key, Object value);

    // Removes the object associated with this key if it owns such record.
    boolean remove(String key);

    // Clears all data owned by this Store.
    void clear();
}
```

### Session Store

Since a Session is not linked to any parent, it is a Root Store.
With it, we can save, retrieve and remove objects by key.

```java
// Save an object in the session store
session.save("key", anyObject);

// Get an object from the session store
// Automatically typecasts to the requested type
AnyType object = session.retrieve("key");
        
// Check if there's an object with that key
boolean isSaved = session.exists("key");

// Check if there's an object with that key equals to the given value
boolean isEquals = session.isEquals("key", anyObject);

// Remove the object from the session store
boolean isRemoved = session.remove("key");
```

### Request Store

Both the Request and the Response is a Store available during the [Request Lifecycle](#processors-middlewares) and accessed within the [Processors](#processors-middlewares).

Having a transient **Request Store** is helpful to share information among **Processors** without cluttering the **Session Store** or **Service Store** that generated it.

The Request Store provides access to the upstream Stores' data. We can even persist data from the Request Store into the parent Stores, though we cannot delete data from them.

When we call `request.retrieve(<key>)`, the Request Store first tries to retrieve the associated object from its own scope. Not finding, it queries the parent Store, and so on until it reaches the Root Store. Also, the result is automatically typecasted to the requested type.

```java
// Get an object from the store or the deriving store
// Automatically typecasts the result
AnyType object = request.retrieve("key");
```

The same underlying Store is shared by a Request and a Response. Hence, we can also access the Request scope Store from the Response, sharing data in a single Request-Response lifecycle.

```java
session.req("/server")
       .save("hidden", true) // save data in the request store
       .get()
       .onLoad(response -> {
            // retrieve data from the request store
            if (response.isEquals("hidden", true)) {
                // do something...
            }
        });
```

To save an object locally, we call `request.save(<key>, <object>)`.
Differently, to save an object in a upstream Store, we call `request.save(<key>, <object>, <level>)`.
If the request was originated from a [Service](#services) and we set the level as `Level.PARENT`, then the data is saved in the Service Store.
But if we set the level as `Level.ROOT`, the data is saved in the Session Store that is linked to the Service.
In the other hand, if the request was directly originated from a [Session](#session), then both `Level.PARENT` and `Level.ROOT` will cause the same effect of saving in the Session Store, because the Request's parent and root Stores are the same.

```java
/* SESSION scenario */
Session session = getSession();

session.get("/server")
       .onLoad(response -> {
            // Save an object in the parent store
            // Since this is a session's request, data is saved in the Session Store
            response.save("key", anyObject, Level.PARENT);

            // Save an object in the root store
            // Since this is a session's request, it has the same effect of the previous
            response.save("key", anyObject, Level.ROOT);
        });
```

```java
/* SERVICE scenario */
Service service = getService();

service.get()
       .onLoad(response -> {
           // Save an object in the parent store
           // Since this is a service's request, data is saved in the Service Store
           response.save("key", anyObject, Level.PARENT);

           // Save an object in the root store
           // It will save in the Session Store from which the Service was created
           response.save("key", anyObject, Level.ROOT);
       });
```

To delete a local record, we call `request.remove(<key>)`. We cannot remove objects from the upstream Stores.

```java
// Delete the record associated with the given key
request.remove("key");

// The response share the same store with the request
response.remove("key");
```

**üí° PRO TIP**: Request scope store is specially useful to deal with exceptional cases in [request/response processors](#processors-middlewares).
For instance, suppose you created processors to show a loading widget when requesting and hide when the response is received or an error occurs.
But, for some reason, you want to make 'hidden' requests, so that the loading widget is not shown.
You can then call `.save("hidden", true)` when building the request and check for this flag in the processors by calling `.isEquals("hidden", true)` to skip displaying the loading widget.
Requestor's showcase app implements such scenario. [Here](https://github.com/reinert/requestor/blob/master/examples/requestor-showcase/src/main/java/io/reinert/requestor/examples/showcase/Showcase.java#L80) a hidden ping request is executed to wake-up the server, and [here](https://github.com/reinert/requestor/blob/master/examples/requestor-showcase/src/main/java/io/reinert/requestor/examples/showcase/ShowcaseDeferredFactory.java#L43) the Request Store is queried to skip showing the loading widget.

### Service Store

A Service is a Store derived from the Session Store.

Having a **Service Store** is helpful to share information in the context of that Service only.

The Service Store provides access to the parent Session Store's data. We can even persist data from the Service Store into the Session Store, though we cannot delete Session's data from it.

When we call `service.retrieve(<key>)`, the Service Store first tries to retrieve the associated object from its own scope. Not finding, it queries the parent Session Store. Also, the result is automatically typecasted to the requested type.

```java
// Get an object from the store or the deriving session store
// Automatically typecasts the result
AnyType object = service.retrieve("key");
```

To save an object locally, we call `service.save(<key>, <object>)`.
Differently, to save an object in the parent Session Store, we call `service.save(<key>, <object>, <level>)`.

```java
Service service = getService();

// Save an object in service scope only
service.save("key", anyObject);

// Save an object in the parent session store
// Level.PARENT causes the same effect here
service.save("key", anyObject, Level.ROOT);
```

To delete a local record, we call `service.remove(<key>)`. We cannot delete records from the parent Session Store.

```java
// Delete the record associated with the given key
service.remove("key");
```


## Services

Requestor introduces the **Service** concept to represent a ***subject-oriented client***. It 
means that a Service should bind together closely related network operations according to some 
criteria. In this sense, if we are consuming a REST API, we can build *Entity- or 
Resource-oriented* Services. Analogously, when consuming RPC APIs, we can create *Feature- or 
Group-oriented* Services.

The `Service` is a **session branch** derived from the main [Session](#session) that holds local 
configurations but residually leverages the main's. Within this coordinated context, we can 
define configurations only related to the target subject without cluttering the main context. In 
other words, the Service's [Request Options](#request-options) and the [Store](#store) are 
independent of the Session's and have preferential usage over it.

In order to create a **Service**, we need to extend the `AbstractService` class and implement 
the network operations related to the server API's subject.

### Extending AbstractService

Requestor follows a design principle of favoring good code design to code generation.
In this sense, a great effort is made in crafting classes that can cohesively be extended or 
composed into new richer components, so the user can quickly build the functionalities he needs.
Thus, to create a client service related to a server subject, we can extend the 
`AbstractService` class and implement our calls, like below:

```java
public class BookService extends AbstractService {

    public BookService(Session session) {
        super(session, "/api/books"); // Provide the root path of the REST resource or RPC group
    }

    public Request<Book> createBook(Book book) {
       Uri uri = getUriBuilder() // get UriBuilder provided by the parent
               .build(); // The UriBuilder starts in the root path, so here we built /api/books uri 
       return req(uri).payload(book).post(Book.class);
    }
   
    public Request<Collection<Book>> getBooks(String... authors) {
        Uri uri = getUriBuilder()
                .queryParam("author", authors) // append ?author={author} to the root path
                .build();
       return req(uri).get(List.class, Book.class);
    }

    public Request<Book> getBookById(Integer id) {
        Uri uri = getUriBuilder()
                .segment(id) // add a path segment with the book id like /api/books/123
                .build();
        return req(uri).get(Book.class);
    }

    public Request<Void> updateBook(Integer id, Book book) {
        Uri uri = getUriBuilder().segment(id).build();
        return req(uri).payload(book).put();
    }

    public Request<Void> deleteBook(Integer id) {
        Uri uri = getUriBuilder().segment(id).build();
        return req(uri).delete();
    }
}
```

Now, use the service:

```java
// It's a good practice to use Session object as a singleton
Session session = getMySession();

// Create your service passing the session instance.
// The service then takes advantage of all the configurations present in the session
BookService bookService = new BookService(session);

// POST a new book to /api/books
Book book = new Book("Clean Code", "Robert C. Martin", new Date(1217552400000L));
bookService.createBook(book).onSuccess( createdBook -> showBook(createdBook) ).onFail(...);

// GET all books from /api/books?author=Martin
bookService.getBooks("Martin").onSuccess( books -> showBooks(books) ).onFail(...);

// GET the book of id 123 from /api/books/123
bookService.getBookById(123).onSuccess( book -> showBook(book) ).onFail(...);

// PUT a book to /api/books/123
bookService.updateBook(123, updatedBook).onSuccess( () -> showSucessMsg() ).onFail(...);

// DELETE the resource /api/books/123
bookService.deleteBook(123).onSuccess( () -> showSucessMsg() ).onFail(...);
```

### Creating the app's abstract Service

It is helpful to handle the errors inside the Service, so we do not always have to set fail callbacks.
Therefore, we recommend implementing an app's abstract Service and extending the client services from it.
This way, it is feasible handle all non-happy paths in one place only. For example, check the 
`applyErrorCallbacks` method below. It adds some predefined callbacks to requests:

```java
public abstract class MyAppService<E> extends AbstractService {

    final Class<E> entityClass;
    final EventBus eventBus;
    
    // Construct your Service with any other object that will allow you to properly handle errors
    public MyAppService(Session session, String baseUri, Class<E> entityClass, EventBus eventBus) {
        super(session, baseUri);
        this.entityClass = entityClass;
        this.eventBus = eventBus;
    }

    // Implement the basic operations common to every resource...
    public Request<E> create(E e) {
        Uri uri = getUriBuilder().build();
        // add the error handling callbacks in the request returned by the post method
        Request<E> request = request(uri).payload(e).post(entityClass);
        return applyErrorCallbacks(request);
    }
    
    // Implement all your service calls following the same pattern...
    private <T> Request<T> applyErrorCallbacks(Request<T> request) {
        return request
                .onStatus(404, response -> handleNotFound(request.getUri()))
                .onStatus(500, response -> handleServerError(response))
                .onTimeout(t -> handleTimeout(t))
                .onError(e -> log(e));
    }

    // Implement supporting methods...
    private void handleNotFound(Uri ui) {
        eventBus.fireEvent(new NotFoundEvent(uri));
    }
}
```

**üí° PRO TIP**: Create your own **"AppAbstractService"** and handle the errors in the superclass to save you coding and maintenance cost.
Use the above example as inspiration as also the [RestService](https://github.com/reinert/requestor/blob/master/requestor/core/requestor-api/src/main/java/io/reinert/requestor/core/RestService.java) class.


## Links (HATEOAS)

Requestor's `Response` interface afford helpful methods to easily grab links from the HTTP Link Header 
by their relations (`rel` attribute).

According to the [RFC 5988](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988), a link element has the following 
attributes: *anchor*, *media*, *hrefLang*, *rel*, *rev*, *title* and *type*. We can access all 
those attributes, and also the properly formed *uri*, through the `Link` interface.

A regular Link Header carries many Link elements, which are normally identified by their relations,
in the following manner:

```text
Link: </the-book/index>; rel="index"; title="Index"; hreflang="en"; type="text/html",
      </the-book/foreword>; rel="foreword"; title="Foreword"; hreflang="en"; type="text/html",
      </the-book/chapter4>; rel="next"; title="Next Chapter"; hreflang="en"; type="text/html",
      </the-book/chapter2>; rel="previous"; title="Previous Chapter"; hreflang="en"; type="text/html"
```

In order to get a specific `Link` from a `Response`, we can call `response.getLink(<rel>)`:

```java
// Get a link by its rel attribute
Link indexLink = response.getLink("index");

// Get the link title
String title = indexLink.getTitle();

// Get the link hrefLang
String lang = indexLink.getHrefLang();

// Get the link type
String type = indexLink.getType();

// Get the parsed link URI
Uri uri = indexLink.getUri();
```

We can also iterate over all links of a `Response` with `response.getLinks()`:

```java
for (Link link : response.getLinks()) {
    view.addLink(link);
}
```

Finally, when requesting, we can directly use the link by calling `session.req(<link>)`:

```java
Request<Void> nextRequest = session.req( response.getLink("next") ).get();
```

The proper usage of links is the key to enter the wonderland of leveraging *hypermedia as the 
engine of application state* (HATEOAS). Requestor encourages its users to heavily rely on links 
when interacting with HTTP APIs and let the server app dictate the paths that the client can take.   

There are some common scenarios that the usage of links reveals to be really valuable like 
**pagination** (*next*, *previous*, *first*, and *last* links), **distributed transactions** 
(*next* and *rollback* links) and **reversible commands** (*undo* link). 

See the pagination example below:

```java
// Supposing we correctly rendered the links in our view
void onLinkClicked(Link link) {
    session.req(link)
            .get(Document.class)
            .onSuccess((content, response) -> {
                view.renderContent(content);
                view.renderLinks(response.getLinks());
            });    
}
```

## Headers
\#TBD: write about the Headers map, the Header abstraction, existing Header implementations and how to extend it.


## URI
Requestor features the `Uri` type to facilitate accessing the URI parts.

Consider the following URI structure:

<img width="708" alt="uri-details" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1285494/145720707-02d772ea-5c51-4324-a7d5-30d7d8e2ecb1.png">

The `Uri` type allows us to access each part of this URI:

```java
Uri uri = Uri.create("https://alice:a1ef34df@example.com:123/discussion;subject=tech/questions/?order=newest&order=alphabetic#top");

// the whole URI as string
String uriString = uri.toString(); 

// main URI parts
String scheme = uri.getScheme();
String user = uri.getUser();
String password = uri.getPassword();
String host = uri.getHost();
int port = uri.getPort();
String path = uri.getPath();
String query = uri.getQuery();
String fragment = uri.getFragment();

// returns ["discussion", "questions"]
List<String> segments = uri.getSegments();

// matrix params by segment
Collection<Uri.Param> discussionParams = uri.getMatrixParams("discussion");
Uri.Param subjectParam = uri.getMatrixParam("discussion", "subject");
String tech = subjectParam.getValue();

// query params
Collection<Uri.Param> queryParams = uri.getQueryParams();
Uri.Param orderParam = uri.getQueryParam("order");
// returns ["newest", "alphabetic"]
List<String> values = orderParam.getValues();
```

When we call `Uri.create` a new Uri object is created with the URI string. However, since the parse operation may be
expensive, this string is not parsed prematurely. Instead, the `Uri.toString()` initially returns the given URI string.
Whenever any other Uri method is called, the string is parsed and the user can access each part individually.

Further, Requestor provides the `UriBuilder` to make it easier to build complex URIs.
The code below shows how to build the above URI:

```java
Uri uri = Uri.builder()
        .scheme("https")
        .user("alice")
        .password("a1ef34df")
        .host("example.com")
        .port(123)
        .segment("discussion")
        .matrixParam("subject", "tech")
        .segment("questions")
        .queryParam("order", "newest", "alphabetic")
        .fragment("top")
        .build();
```

Finally, notice that all URI parts are properly decoded when parsing and encoded when building by the `UriCodec`.

## Requesting Fluent API

The Fluent API was designed to provide an enjoyable coding experience while requesting through a chainable interface. Here is how it works:
1. The client `Session` is the starting point when requesting.
2. It exposes the `req(<uri>)` method that returns a `RequestInvoker`, which has request building and invoking capabilities.
3. `RequestInvoker` implements the chainable `RequestBuilder` interface, which allows us to set the request options.
4. Further, `RequestInvoker` implements the `Invoker` interface, which allows us to send the request by calling one of the HTTP Methods.
5. When invoking the request, we also need to specify the class type we expect as the response payload.
6. The request invoking methods return a `Request<T>` according to the expected type we specified.
7. The `Request<T>` interface enables callback chaining so that we can handle different results neatly.

In summary, these are the three requesting steps:
1. Build the request
2. Invoke an HTTP method
3. Chain callbacks

```java
//========================================
// 1. Build the request
//========================================

RequestInvoker req = session.req("/api/books")
        .timeout(10_000) // Set the request timeout in milliseconds
        .delay(2000) // Set the request delay in milliseconds (wait 2s before sending the request)
        .contentType("aplication/json") // Set the Content-Type header
        .accept("text/plain") // Set the Accept header
        .header("Accept-Encoding", "gzip") // Set a custom header 
        .auth(new BasicAuth("username", "password")) // Set the authentication (more on this later)
        .payload(book); // Set the payload to be serialized in the request body


//========================================
// 2. Invoke an HTTP method
//========================================

// Send a POST request expecting an Integer as response
Request<Integer> postReq = req.post(Integer.class);

// Send a GET request expecting a Set of Books as response
Request<Collection<Book>> getReq = req.get(Set.class, Book.class);

// Send a DELETE request ignoring the response body
Request<Void> delReq = req.delete();

// PUT, PATCH, HEAD and OPTIONS are also available but were omitted for didactic purposes


//========================================
// 3. Chain callbacks
//======================================== 

// You can chain single method callbacks (functional interfaces) to handle success, failure or both: 
postReq.onSuccess(payload -> showSuccess(payload)) // Response was 2xx and body was deserialized as Integer
       .onFail(response -> showError(response.getStatus())) // Response was unsuccessful (status ‚â† 2xx)
       .onError(exception -> log(exception)); // Request was not performed

// If you requested a collection of objects, you can retrieve the deserialized payload as well:
getReq.onSuccess(books -> renderTable(books)); // Response was deserialized into a Set of Book objects

// If you want to access the Response in success, declare an additional argument in the callback
delReq.onSuccess((payload, response) -> { // Response returned 2xx
    HttpStatus status = response.getStatus(); // Get the response status
    Headers headers = response.getHeaders(); // Get all headers so you can iterate on them
    String hostHeader = response.getHeader("Host"); // Get the Host header
    String contentType = response.getContentType(); // Get the Content-Type header
    Link undoLink = response.getLink("undo"); // Get the 'undo' relation of the Link header
});

// You can even deal with specific responses status codes and timeout events
delReq.onStatus(400, response -> alert("Response was 400: " + response.getStatus().getReasonPhrase()))
      .onStatus(429, response -> alert("Response was 429: " + response.getStatus().getReasonPhrase()))
      .onStatus(500, response -> alert("Response was 500: " + response.getStatus().getReasonPhrase()))
      .onTimeout(e -> alert("Request timed out in " + e.getTimeoutMillis() / 1000 + "s."));
```

### **‚ù§Ô∏è Write beautiful code**
Joining the three parts together you can write a clean code like below.

```java
// Post a book to the server and retrieve the created entity
session.req("/api/books")
       .payload(book)
       .post(Book.class)
       .onSuccess(book -> view.render(book))
       .onFail(Notifications::showError);
```
