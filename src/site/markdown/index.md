# Requestor

Requesting is the most common operation in AJAX applications.
GWT is an excellent platform for developing AJAX applications, but it still bother us when it comes to requesting.
Using RequestBuilder, the default GWT way of requesting, is a low-level approach which requires too many steps and manual processing to achieve meaningful data for our application.
Requestor solves theses issues with a full featured and fluent API for requesting.
A real HTTP Client API for GWT, it is made upon modern programming concepts like Promises and Method Chaining, and is designed to be as extensible as possible.
Carefully crafted, Requestor provides many features while allows the easy configuration and customization of them all.
